Capstone Project Idea Brief for SSIT Solutions
1. Why This Project Was Made
Problem Statement:
India’s SMEs and individuals face two critical challenges:

High Operating Costs: Inefficient IT infrastructure (e.g., outdated servers, unoptimized cloud usage) wastes energy and money.
Sustainability Blind Spot: No affordable tools exist to measure and reduce tech-related carbon emissions, despite India’s 2070 net-zero goal and global ESG compliance pressures.
Solution:
The AI-Powered Carbon Footprint Tracker solves these by:

Reducing Energy Costs: Identifying inefficiencies in IT systems (e.g., underutilized servers).
Enabling Sustainability Compliance: Providing actionable insights to cut emissions and generate ESG-ready reports.
2. Core Feature (MVP)
AI-Powered IT Carbon Footprint Tracker

Energy Monitoring: Track energy usage of servers, devices, and cloud services.
Emission Estimation: AI calculates emissions using India’s regional energy mix (coal vs. renewables).
Actionable Insights: Recommendations like "Switch to energy-efficient hardware" or "Optimize cloud usage."
Gamification: "Green IT Certificates" and leaderboards to incentivize adoption.

4. Daily Plan 
(Focus: Carbon Footprint Tracker MVP)

Day 1: Frontend Setup
Morning:

Install necessary tools for frontend development:
Node.js (for React.js setup).
VS Code (code editor).
React.js (create a new project using npx create-react-app).
Familiarize yourself with React basics if needed (use free resources like freeCodeCamp).
Afternoon:

Set up the folder structure for the frontend:
Create folders for components (e.g., Header, Footer, Dashboard).
Add basic CSS files or use a library like Bootstrap for styling.
Evening:

Test the React app by running it locally (npm start) to ensure everything is working.
Day 2: Backend Setup
Morning:

Install necessary tools for backend development:
Node.js + Express.js (set up a new project using npm init).
Install required packages like express, mongoose (for MongoDB), and cors.
Afternoon:

Create basic API endpoints:
/api/carbon for carbon emission calculations.
/api/login for user authentication (placeholder for now).
Connect to MongoDB Atlas (free tier) for database storage.
Evening:

Test the backend APIs using Postman to ensure they are functional.
Day 3: Creating the Main Page
Morning:

Design the main landing page of the website:
Add a hero section with the company mission statement.
Include a brief description of the AI-Powered Carbon Footprint Tracker.
Add a call-to-action button (e.g., "Get Started" or "Contact Us").
Afternoon:

Integrate the frontend and backend:
Fetch data from the backend API (e.g., /api/carbon) and display it on the frontend.
Use Chart.js to visualize sample carbon emission data.
Evening:

Test the full flow:
Ensure the landing page loads correctly.
Verify that the frontend communicates with the backend.
Phase	Timeline	Key Tasks
